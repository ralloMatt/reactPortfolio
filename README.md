# My React Portfolio

## Description

My online portfolio using Javascritp React. There is only technically one webpage that uses React to switch up componenets. My main component is called MyWebsite.jsx. Which includes the Header (navigation), then the contentpages (look at directory) which loads the about me page by default, and lastly the footer which has links to my online stuff. Depending on what the user clicks in the navigation page determines which component is loaded. 

My Portfolio page has a list of my projects. Be sure to click on them to find the deployed projects. Also check out their repositories by clicking on the Github Repo link.
